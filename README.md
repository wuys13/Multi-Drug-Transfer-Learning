# Multi-Drug-Transfer-Learning
Pre-clinical drug discovery faces the low efficiency dilemma. One of the reasons is the lack of cross-drug efficacy evaluation infrastructure at patient level. Here we propose Patient multiple drug learning(P-MDL) task, and construct the P-MDL dataset and model zoo. The best P-MDL model DSN-adv achieve SOTA in all of the 13 tumor types.
